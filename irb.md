## Want to get involved in the project? 

### Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements: 

Since we are conducting research with human subjects, we are required to get IRB approval. Here's what you need to do: 

#### Step 1. Take the certification in CITI 

- Go to the training portal: https://www.citiprogram.org/?pageID=668
- Type in *_Berea College_*
- Choose the course: *_Social & Behavioral Research - Basic/Refresher_*
- Complete the training. There is a visual or reading format. I have found that the reading format works best for me.
  
If you have any questions let Belen know :) 

#### Step 2. Upload your certification on the IRB website (Sitero Mentor)

- Go to: https://www.axiommentor.com/login/shibLogin.cfm?requestURL=https://shib.axiommentor.com/pages/irb/members.cfm 
- Under Institution ID type in: berea
- Under CITI documentation, click on upload file to upload your CITI certification.

and that's it!
